# WWDC-2023 | Gambling For Living?
This project aims to promote responsible gambling

Through the project I want to help gamblers understand which games have the potential to be profitable in the long term, and which ones are impossible to win since they are designed to favor the house. They can either treat gambling as a fun activity without going broke or become professionals by developing and learning the necessary skills.
